\begin{abstract}
    VexCL is vector expression template library created for ease of C++ based
    OpenCL developement. This article gives short introduction to the
    programming interface of the library. Performance of the library is
    compared with existing general purpose and linear algebra GPGPU packages.

\section{Introduction}

Recently, GPGPU based computing has aquiered considerable momentum in
scientific community. This is confirmed by constantly increasing number of GPU
based supercomputers in
top500\footnote{\href{http://top500.org/}{http://top500.org/}} list. Major
programming frameworks are NVIDIA CUDA and OpenCL.  The former is proprietary
parallel computing architecture developed by Nvidia for general purpose
computing on Nvidia graphics cards, and the latter is open, royalty-free
standard for cross-platform, parallel programming of modern processors backed
by Khronos group.
