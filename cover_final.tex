\opening{Dear Dr.~Haase,}

On behalf of all the authors, I would like to submit the revised version of
manuscript entitled ``Programming CUDA and OpenCL: a Case Study Using Modern
C++ Libraries'' for publication in the ``Software and High-Performance
Computing'' section of SIAM Journal of Scientific Computing.

Referee \#1 noted several inconsistencies in the code samples and suggested to avoid sloppy language.
We double-checked all the code snippets, applied corrections where necessary, 
and correspondingly rephrased a couple of sentences.

Referee \#2 was completely satisfied with the previous revision.

We would like to thank both Referees and the editorial board for their quick
responses.

The co-authors of the paper are: Dr.~Karsten Ahnert (karsten.ahnert@gmx.de,
Ambrosys GmbH, Geschw.-Scholl-Str.63a, 14471 Potsdam, Germany), Dr.~Karl Rupp
(rupp@mcs.anl.gov, Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National
Laboratory, 9700 South Cass Avenue, Argonne, IL 60439, USA), and Dr.~Peter
Gottschling (Peter.Gottschling@tu-dresden.de, Technische Universit\"at Dresden,
Institut f\"ur Wissenschaftliches Rechnen, 01062 Dresden, Germany).

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
